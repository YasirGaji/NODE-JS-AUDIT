KINEMATICS :
  s=ut+ 1/2at^2 (Equation of motion)
  v = u + at (Velocity equation)
  V^2 = u^2 + 2as (Velocity-time-distance relationship)

DYNAMICS : 
  F = ma (Newton's second law)
  W = mg (Weight)
  f = μN (Frictional force)

CIRCULAR MOTION : 
  V = wr (Linear velocity in circular motion)
  a = v^2/r (Centripetal acceleration)

ENERGY : 
  Ek = 1/2mv^2 (Kinetic energy)
  Ep = mgh (Potential energy due to gravity)
  W = Fd (Work done)

THERMODYNAMICS : 
  Q = mcΔT (Heat transfer)
  PV = nRT (Ideal gas law)

WAVES : 
  v = fλ (Wave equation)
  f = 1/T (Frequency and period relationship)

OPTICS : 
  1/f = 1/do + 1/di (Lens formula)
  v = u + at (Mirror formula)

ELECTROMAGNETISM : 
  V = IR (ohm's law)
  Q = It (Charge = Current x Time)
